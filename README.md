# Twitter_Tweet_Sentiment-NPL
Made a NPL model that can categorise Twitter tweets as Positive, Negative, or neutral. 


In this notebook I have made use of the tensorflow tokenization to convert the data into arrays(after preprocessing it). After tokenizing all the words, I padded them to their respective sentences and finally trained the model using LSTM, Dropout, Embedding, Dense, GlobalMaxPool1D. 

At the end, I have attached a model to predict the future tweets as well.
